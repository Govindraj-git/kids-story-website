        <h1>The two friend of yes or no</h1>
        <p class="p1">Long ago, there was a rock floating through space, searching for where she belonged. She would visit many planets and travel to the farthest reaches of the universe, but would she find what she was looking for? The Stellar One is a tale of self-esteem and self-discovery.</p>

        <p class="p1">When the universe was young, the sky was filled with planets, stars, stardust, and many, many rocks.</p>

        <p class="p1">She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green. At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all.</p>

        <p class="p1">Gus had a little friend, a happy and generous girl called Gladys. Gladys was the only one who had been willing to hang around with Gus during all those black, rainy days. All the other children had run off to avoid getting soaked and ending up completely black. One day, one of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest. She was unlike any that came before her. She said to him: "Cheer up! What you should realize is that you're the only one of us who has his very own cloud, and even better, its rain is black! We could play some fun games with a cloud like this, don't you reckon?"</p>

        <p class="p1">As Gladys was his only company these days, and he didn't want her to leave as the others had, Gus reluctantly agreed.</p>

        <p class="p1">The rock had never gone anywhere before and wasn't sure how to go about it. She started to rock back and forth. Then she started to spin. Soon enough, she was flying through the sky. As she left, clouds swirled on the big blue planet. For it was sad to see her go, and when planets cry, there is a rain storm.</p>

        <p class="p1">Gus would find cats and run alongside them. When the cats felt themselves getting wet, they would jump about in the craziest way and run off at top speed, with funny looks on their faces. Before long, all the children in town had gathered around Gus, thinking up new games they could play using the cloud.</p>

        <p class="p1">This made her stop for a moment. “I do not know where I should go next,” she said out loud. “Each direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.”</p>

        <p class="p1">“You are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,” said the big blue planet. “You have grown bold and bright. Now you are a shooting star, and you are the reason that I shine. And while you are worrying about which direction to go, all of the planets in space are hoping that you will come their way to brighten them.”</p>

        <p class="p1">And the good thing about Chuckles' departure was that no longer was Gus soaking wet all day. Now he could go and do dry things, and that's exactly what he did.</p>
